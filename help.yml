  Use `?help [command]` for more information on a command. When using `?help [command]`, the `[command]`
  argument should be the *full* command name; command aliases are not accepted.

# For the warn command, add in what happens when the bot tries to DM a user that's not on the server
moderation:
  warn:
    mod_command?: true
    usage: "?warn <user> <reason> | Use ?help warn for more details on how to use this command."
    overview: "•`?warn <user>` - Warns a user."
    description: >
      •`?warn <user> <reason>`
      
      When this command is used, the bot will send a DM to the user telling them
      that they were warned, and the reason for it. If a DM could not be sent to the
      user, the bot will inform the moderator that the user could not be DM'd. The warn
      will still be logged in the mod log channel.


      This command accepts user ID's and user mentions as the "user" argument.

  mute:
    mod_command?: true
    usage: "?mute <user> <mute length> <reason> or ?mute <user> <reason> | Use ?help mute for more details on how to use this command."
    overview: "•`?mute <user> <mute length> <reason>` or `?mute <user> <reason>` - Mutes a user."
    description: >
      •`?mute <user> <mute length> <reason>` or `?mute <user> <reason>`

      When this command is used, a DM will be sent to the user telling them that they have been muted and
      they will be given the muted role. The muted role will either be removed after the specified mute duration
      has passed or it will stay indefinitely until removed by a moderator using the `?unmute` command.
      Manually removing the muted role during a mute will *not* end the mute.


      In order to give an indefinite mute, omit the "mute length" argument. If you want to give a timed mute,
      a certain time format has to be used - days are represented with 'd', hours with 'h', minutes with 'm', 
      and seconds with 's'. These can be combined together, if desired. Let's say, for instance, you wanted to 
      mute someone for 6 hours; you would type in '6h' when prompted for a mute time. If you wanted to mute 
      someone for 12 hours and 30 minutes, you would type '12h30m'.


      This command accepts user ID's and user mentions as the "user" argument.

  unmute:
    mod_command?: true
    usage: "?unmute <user> | Use ?help unmute for more details on how to use this command."
    overview: "•`?unmute <user>` - Unmutes a user."
    description: >
      •`?unmute <user>`

      When this command is used, a DM will be sent to the user saying that they have been unmuted and the muted
      role will be removed. If the original mute was a timed mute, the timer will be stopped.


      This command accepts user ID's and user mentions as the "user" argument.

  getmute:
    mod_command?: true
    usage: "?getmute <user> | Use ?help getmute for more details on how to use this command."
    overview: "•`?getmute <user>` - Shows details about a user's mute."
    description: >
      •`?getmute <user>`

      When this command is used, the following details about that user's mute will be shown: the mute reason,
      the mute length, and the time left.


      This command accepts user ID's and user mentions as the "user" argument.
